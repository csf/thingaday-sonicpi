# Day 4

"Get this published" day. No time for Sonic Pi, tonight I just set up the repo and got it up on GitHub.

With time, I'll automate the whole publishing thing. I haven't yet looked into whether it is possible to play a .wav directly from a `README.md` file. And no real grasp of terminology of music, looping, DJing, or whatever it is one does while live coding in Sonic Pi.
