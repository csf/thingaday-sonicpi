# Day2
Some attempts at various blues progressions.

The first one,  [blues_random_synth.rb](./blues_random_synth.rb), is just one of the tutorial samples with a few chords in it to see what a blues progression sounds like. There's no trace of blues in it because I used major chords and there's no real progression at all discernible. Then I went to wikipedia to learn more.

The second one, [bluesprog_try1.rb](./bluesprog_try1.rb), gets the progression right but is rigidlyrobotic...doesn't swing. 

I finally landed that had some semblence of a progression, albeit reminiscent of a skating rink. [ratchety_distorted_blues.rb](./ratchety_distorted_blues.rb) taught me how to work with `with_fx` and how to play around with time and sampling to shape a sound like a bass guitar out of a plain old sample. Basically, how to use distortion and mono fx. There are some other commented-out FX and parameters to try at some point. It's not great, but closer to something I imagined and got within the ballpark. I started playing around with attack and release. Starting to learn how to organize code for live coding, and how to sync time among live_loops. This is still a building block.
