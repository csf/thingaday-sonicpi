# Day 3

Only one thing here which I whipped up before dinner to amuse the kid: [gob.rb](./gob.rb).

Nothing cool here other than I figured out how to sync a little better. And if you set all the amp: parameters to 0, you can start adding live_loops to the mix from top to bottom by setting the amp values to whatever level you want. First time I sort of felt like I was improvising and making something.

There's some sort of glitch there, I think, related to the timing that seems to happen every 2nd or 4th time the `:loop_garzul` is hit.

A long way to go. None of these really stand alone yet--I'm just exploring the language and resources. More building blocks.

If you want to give a listen, grab [this.wav file](./gob.wav).
